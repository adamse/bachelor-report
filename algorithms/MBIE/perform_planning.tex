\paragraph{How often to perform planning}
\label{sec:mbie_perform_planning}

It is possible to perform planning and compute a new policy once for each
action taken by the agent. However, this would be unnecessarily slow to
compute. The planning comprises iterating Q-value updates to convergence and
then using these converged values to update V-tables, a considerable number of
computations. So instead of planning after every action taken, the algorithm
only performs planning and updates the policy at some given interval. 

A way to do this that we have used is to only perform an update when the
number of times a specific state-action pair has been visited has doubled. For
larger variants of the invasive species environment we perform planning when
the number of actions taken has been multiplied by 1.5.
