\paragraph{One policy per state variable}
\label{sec:one_policy_per_state_variable}

For some MDPs it is possible to create a separate policy for each state
variable individually. This is the case when there is a separate action taken
for each state variable, which is true for the Invasive Species environment
(section \ref{sec:experiment_env}). In the implementation of \etre\ used in
this thesis, this policy creation is performed in two steps. 

In the first step, a policy is calculated for state variables that have no
other state variables than themselves as parents in the DBN, and these states
are marked as done. Since there is now a decided action for each value for the
these state variables, the transition probabilities for these variables can be
considered as pure Markov chains in the next step. In this step, a policy is found for state
variables whose parents are marked as done, until all state variables are done.
In this second step, the transition probabilities of the parents are thus
treated as independent of the action taken.

Planning for each state variable individually has the benefit of making the
planning algorithm linear in the number of state variables, greatly reducing
the time needed to calculate a policy. However, there are several downsides to
using this kind of approximation, some of which are discussed in section
\ref{sec:e3_factored_discussion}.
