\paragraph{One policy per state variable}
\label{sec:one_policy_per_state_variable}

For some MDPs it is possible to create a separate policy for each state
variable individually. This is the case when there is a separate action taken
for each state variable, which is true for the invasive species environment
(section \ref{sec:experiment_env}). In the implementation of \etre\ used in
this thesis, this policy creation is performed in two steps. 

Planning for each state variable individually has the benefit of making the planning algorithm linear in the number of state variables, greatly reducing the time until an agent can enter the exploitation phase for large state spaces. However, there are several downsides to using this kind of approximation, some of which are discussed in section \ref{sec:e3_factored_discussion}.
