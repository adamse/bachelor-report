\section{Model-based interval estimation}
\label{sec:mbie}

Model-based interval estimation modifies value iteration with confidence
intervals. These confidence intervals allow the agent to choose between
actions, based on how confident it is about its evaluation of them. In effect,
the less certain the agent is about its evaluation of the states and actions,
the more exploratory the actions will be. When the agent is more confident
however, it will exploit what it has learnt so far about the MDP
\parencite{dietterich2013pac}.
