\chapter{Environment and algorithms}
\label{ch:algo}

This chapter gives a description of the environment and the algorithms that
were used in the experiment described in chapter \ref{ch:method}. The environment Invasive Species, is a simulation of a river network with invading species where to goal is to eradicate unwanted species and is further described in section \ref{sec:experiment_env}. 

Two algorithms are covered in this chapter, both of which deal with the
problems that arise with large state spaces; however, they differ in the
methods they apply. In the following chapter the general ideas behind the
algorithms, as well as specific details, are presented. 

The model-based interval estimation algorithm, described in
section~\ref{sec:mbie}, utilizes clever estimations of confidence intervals for
the state-action value functions to improve performance in sparse MDPs.
Section~\ref{sec:fac_e3} is on an algorithm that uses dynamic bayesian networks
and factored representations to improve the \etre\ algorithm to efficiently
deal with factored MDPs.
