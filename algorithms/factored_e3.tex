\section{\etre\ in factored Markov Decision Processes}
\label{sec:fac_e3}

The second algorithm studied in this thesis is a version of the \etre\ algorithm that focuses on factored problem domains by modeling them as a dynamic Bayesian network. The original \etre\ algorithm is described in section \ref{sec:e3}, which gives a broad overview along with the key strategies used in the algorithm. The following section, \ref{sec:factored_e3}, considers some ways to extend the original algorithm and make use of factored representations and planning in factored domains to improve the running time of the algorithm.
