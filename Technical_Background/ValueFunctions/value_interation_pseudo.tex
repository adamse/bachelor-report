Initialization
	Repeat
	For every state s
		Update V(s) with: The action which generates highest sum of (the probability that the next state will be s’, due to each of the allowed actions, multiplied with the addition of the expected reward and V(s’)). 
	If the value function only changed more than a small value then go to Repeat.
