\paragraph{Reward function}

An MDP has a reward function $R(s, a)$. This describes the probability distribution of rewards that will be returned by the environment, given the current state s, the action taken, $a$. This reward function (or an approximation thereof, based on previous experiences) is used by algorithms (decision making methods?) in order to to reach a policy that, given an MDP, maximizes the reward over time. \parencite{altman2002applications}.
