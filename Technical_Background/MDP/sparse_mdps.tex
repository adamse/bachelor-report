\subsection{Sparse MDPs}

If there are only a few states $s'$ for which $P(s, a, s') > 0$, the MDP is called a sparse MDP. That is to say, when an agent performs a certain action, $a$, in a certain state, $s$, the environment can only end up in a small fraction out of the total number of states. If an MDP is sparse, there are several possible optimizations that can be performed \parencite{dietterich2013pac}. The MBIE algorithm (section \ref{sec:mbie}) can be extended to utilize such optimizations, one of which is described in section \ref{sec:mbie_gt}.
