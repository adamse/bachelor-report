The term artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy who described it as ``the science and engineering of making intelligent machines'' \parencite{McCarthy2007:Online}. More specifically, it addresses creating intelligent computer machines or software that can achieve specified goals computationally. These goals can comprise anything, e.g. writing poetry, playing complex games such as chess or diagnosing diseases. Different branches of artificial intelligence include planning, reasoning, pattern recognition and the focus of this thesis: learning from experience.
This chapter gives a more formal description of reinforcement learning and the main topics and concepts necessary to understand the rest of the report.
