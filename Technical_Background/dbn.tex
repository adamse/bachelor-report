\section{Dynamic Bayesian networks}

A Bayesian network is a graphical model that represents random variables and
their dependencies on eachother (see figure~\ref{fig:bn}). Each random variable
corresponds to a node and a directed edge represents a dependency between the
target and the source node. \parencite{heckerman1998tutorial}. For instance in
figure~\ref{fig:bn} $Z$ depends on the setting of $X$ and $Y$.

A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a Bayesian network where the random
variables are allowed to depend on prior settings of the same random variables
as well as eachother, see figure~\ref{fig:dbn}.

In Bayesian networks as well as dynamic Bayesian networks one can define the
parents of a random variable to be the variables that it depends on. In the
Bayesian network in figure~\ref{fig:bn} the parents of $Z$ are $pa(Z) = \{X,
Y\}$ and in figure~\ref{fig:dbn} the parents of $Y$ are $pa(Y_{t+1}) = \{Y_t,
X_t\}$.

Transition probabilities for the states of an MDP can be represented by a set
of Bayesian networks, one network for each possible action. Such a network is
comprised of a node, $n_i$, for each state variable, representing that state
variable at time $t$, as well as a node, $n_i'$ for each state variable
representing the value of that state variable at time $t+1$. If the probability
distribution of a certain state variable $n_k'$ is affected by the value of
another state variable $n_j$ if action $a$ is taken then there is a directed
edge from $n_j$ to $n_k'$ in the DBN corresponding to action $a$
