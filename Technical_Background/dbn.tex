\section{Dynamic bayesian networks}
\label{sec:dbn}

A bayesian network is a graphical model that represents random variables and
their dependencies on each other (see figure~\ref{fig:bn}). Each random variable
corresponds to a node and a directed edge represents a dependency between the
target and the source node \parencite{heckerman1998tutorial}. For instance in
figure~\ref{fig:bn}, $Z$ depends on the setting of $X$ and $Y$.

A dynamic bayesian network (DBN) is a bayesian network where the random
variables are allowed to depend on prior settings of the same random variables
as well as each other, see figure~\ref{fig:dbn}.

In bayesian networks as well as dynamic bayesian networks one can define the
parents of a random variable to be the variables that it depends on. In the
bayesian network in figure~\ref{fig:bn} the parents of $Z$ are $pa(Z) = \{X,
Y\}$ and in figure~\ref{fig:dbn} the parents of $Y$ are $pa(Y_{t+1}) = \{Y_t,
X_t\}$.

States in an MDP can be factored into several state variables representing
different features of the state. Using this factorization transition
probabilities can be represented by a set of bayesian networks, one network for
each possible action. 

In each network every state variable, $s_t(i)$, is a node representing the
state variable at time $t$, as well as a node, $s_{t+1}(i)$, representing the same state
variable at time $t+1$. If the probability distribution of a certain state
variable $s_{t+1}(i)$ is affected by the value of another state variable
$s_t(j)$ if action $a$ is taken then there is a directed edge from $s_t(j)$ to
$s_{t+1}(i)$ in the DBN corresponding to action $a$
\parencite{guestrin2003efficient}.
