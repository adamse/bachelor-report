This chapter is a discussion of the results and method used in the project. The algorithms are evaluated with regard to their performance achieved in the tests, which is used as a basis when comparing them against each-other. Determining their strengths and weaknesses and if they were suitable for problems with an environment that has a large discrete state space and in particular for the environment Invasive Species. There is also a discussion on ethical aspects regarding the work in this thesis.


% Det behövs inte en ingående disposition här, det tar ner läsligheten. Det som tas upp i styckena är vettigt, men detta är inte rätt ställe för dem.

% This chapter is a combination of discussion of the results of using the algorithms described in chapter \ref{ch:algo}, together with a examination of the method used in the project. The algorithms is evaluated with regard to their performance achieved in the experiments \ref{sec:constructing_experiments}, which is used for a basis when comparing them against each-other. Focusing on their strengths and weaknesses and circling around the question why did they perform as they did. Were they suitable for this kind of problem, an environment with a large discrete state space and in particular for this thesis a simulation of an Invasive Species environment.

% The second part of this chapter contains a section containing a presentation of similar studies conducted, summarizing their results and opinions. Using their finding as a basis, there will also be a discussion regarding its connection to the results in this thesis. With inspiration from similar studies in combination with the results of this thesis, a discussion about the possible extensions and additional work or unanswered questions in this thesis are presented. 

%In order to round of this chapter, the last section of this chapter revolves around ethical questions and aspects regarding the theme of this topic. The main theme of the last section is ethical aspects in \acrlong{ai} \acrshort{ai}, \acrfull{ai}, along with a discussion about the usefulness of Reinforcement Learning in today's society with focus on using simulations.
