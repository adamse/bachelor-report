\subsection{Extend MBIE to utilize a factored representation}
\label{sec:factored_mbie}

In the discussion of this thesis the issue with an unfairness when
comparing the two agents studied has been highlighted. Due to lack of
understanding we chose to not implement a factored MBIE. We could not simply
add the factored representation to the MBIE algorithm due to diverging source
trees when we realised our mistake. Therefore as an extension to this thesis
the implemented MBIE algorithm could be extended to make use of an dynamic
bayesian network as the underlying model. This would have paved way for more
interesting test results.
