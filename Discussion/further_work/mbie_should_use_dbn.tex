\subsection{Extend MBIE to utilize a factored representation}
\label{sec:factored_mbie}

In the discussion of this thesis, the issue of unfairness when
comparing the two agents has been highlighted. Due to lack of
foresight we chose to not implement a factored version of MBIE. We could not simply
add the factored representation to the MBIE algorithm due to diverging source
trees when we realized our mistake. Therefore as an extension to this thesis
the implemented MBIE algorithm could be extended to make use of a dynamic
bayesian network as the underlying model. This would have paved way for more
interesting test results.
