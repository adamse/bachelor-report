\subsection{Extend MBIE to utilize a factored representation}
\label{sec:factored_mbie}

Throughout the discussion of this thesis the issue with an unfairness when
comparing the two agents studied has been highlighted. Due to our lack of
understanding we chose to not implement a factored MBIE. We could not simply
add the factored representation to the MBIE algortihm due to diverging source
trees when we realised our mistake.

Therefore as an extension to this thesis the implemted MBIE algorithm could be
extendend to make use of an dynamic bayesian network as underlying model. This
would have paved way for more interesting test results.
