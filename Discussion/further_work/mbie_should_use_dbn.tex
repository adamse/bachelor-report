\subsection{Extend MBIE to utilize a factored representation \note{N}}
\label{sec:factored_mbie}
Through the discussion of this thesis the issue with an unfairness when comparing the two agents studied has been highlighted. Due to the reasons described in section \todo[]{vart tar vi p√• oss bajset?} the MBIE algorithm did not make use of a factored representation as model for the algorithm. This resulted in that the conclusion discussed in section \ref{sec:dbn_vs_mbie} could no be concluded, regarding the fact that a good factored underlying model outperforms a good algorithm. Therefore as an extension to this thesis the already functioning MBIE should be extendend to make use of an dynamic Bayesian network as underlying model. Thereby enabling the possibility to verify the theory regarding the performance improvments when utilizing a factored representations when the structure of the environment is known.
\todo[inline]{Perhaps to wide conclusion?}
