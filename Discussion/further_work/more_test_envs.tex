\subsection{Testing algorithms with more environments}

As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:impact_of_one_env} only one environment is
used for testing. Due to the close ties to the invasive species environment
during development there is a risk that the algorithms as implemented will not
perform well in other environments. By using several environments in testing
one can study the generality of the algorithms and maybe improve them. One
possible environment to extend the study with is the Tetris domain representing
the game of Tetris from the 2008 edition of the Reinforcement Learning
Competition \parencite{whiteson2010reinforcement}.
