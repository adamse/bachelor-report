\subsection{Improvements to MBIE}

\textcite{dietterich2013pac} suggests several imrovements to a confidence interval based algorithm called DDV. In MBIE we implement some of these improvements, such as the Good-Turing optimisation (see section~\ref{sec:mbie_gt}), but \textcite{dietterich2013pac} suggests several more, their DDV algorithm promises to ``terminate[\ldots] with a policy that is approximately optimal with high probability after only polynomially many calls to the simulator''.
