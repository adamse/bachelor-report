\subsection{Impact of using one environment}
\label{sec:impact_of_one_env}

The results presented in this report are only collected from one environment.
Considering this, it is challenging to evaluate and verify the generality of the
implementations. The DBN-\etre\ implementation is specifically optimized for the Invasive Species
environment, which reduces the credibility regarding the generality of the
techniques discussed in this thesis, due to the fact that it is not possible
within the scope of this thesis to evaluate the performance of the DBN-\etre\,
without the optimizations applied. 

The generality of our MBIE implementation is more probable due to the fact it was simultaneously
tested alongside Invasive Species in a simpler environment: GridWorld
(section~\ref{sec:intro_grid_world}), thereby forcing a degree of generality during
construction of the agent.
