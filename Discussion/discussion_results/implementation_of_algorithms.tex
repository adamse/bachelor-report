\subsection{Implementation of algorithms}

One of the biggest challenges when constructing and evaluating algorithms is to
validate the actual implementation of the algorithm. When results seem 
erroneous it is hard to immediately realize whether it is the code that contains bugs or that the 
math was incorrectly interpreted. The lack of similar work containing results
also makes it hard to estimate of how well our algorithms do in comparison 
to similar implementations.

In order to increase the credibility of the implementations used one method is
to perform unit testing of the implementation. By creating implementations
which enable unit testing it becomes easier to test the individual pieces of
the algorithms and thereby verify correct behavior. Comparing the process of
using automated tests with manually validating the results of the complete
algorithms behavior as described in section \ref{sec:implementation}, the
advantages are obvious.
