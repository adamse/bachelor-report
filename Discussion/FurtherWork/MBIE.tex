One extension that would be interesting to implement is the DDV-algorithm on which the author says: "(a) DDV requires fewer samples than existing methods to
achieve good performance and (b) DDV terminates with a
policy that is approximately optimal with high probability
after only polynomially-many calls to the simulator" \parencite{dietterich2013pac}.
