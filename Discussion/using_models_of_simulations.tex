\section{Using models for simulating real world problems}
\label{sec:ethics_inv_spec}

This section focuses on the further impact of reinforcement learning using models of the real world and simulations. The environment Invasive Species is a simulation of the problem with invasive
species. This domain focuses on the problem where a spreading process needs to be controlled in a
river network with native and invading plant species

It is commonly known how fragile ecosystems are to changes. Ecosystems are often complex
and it is common that changes that help the system in the short term can damage it in the long
run. By using simulations with self-learning algorithms it is possible to test
more methods than time and money would allow in the real world to find good long-term policies. This 
presents a practical use of reinforcement learning.
However, as simulations are only rough models
of the real world the results from the simulation will also at best only be roughly
correct.
