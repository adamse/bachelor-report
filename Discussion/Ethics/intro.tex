What we do in this thesis is evaluating and comparing two already existing algorithms and techniques. Due to the fact that they both operate using simulations in this study it becomes hard to make any conclusions regarding its direct impact on matters such as ethics, social or economics on today's society. Therefore this sections focuses on some of the futher impact of reinforcemnet learning using models of the real world and simulations along with a high-level discussion regarding right or wrong with artificial intelligence.
