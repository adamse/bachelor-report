% Stycket säger att vi investerar för mycket tid och pengar. Varför är det läskigt att folk inte vet att det investeras tid och pengar i AI?
Reinforcement Learning or the even more general field Artificial Intelligence is a constant trending topic among ethical discussions. There is a ongoing debate going on focusing on if it is right or wrong investing the kind of money and time into research within AI. With regard to the significant progress made in commercialising many of the scientific progress, the debate is even more relevant today than ever. Nevertheless, perhaps the most frightening part is that the majority of people is not even being aware of it. In this section a number of applications relevant in today's society is under discussion, with focus rather on the ethical aspects of its applications than on the technology behind the applications. This section does not touch upon the reinforcement learning field directly, however the discussion is as relevant regardless of the sub-field within AI. Section \ref{sec:ethics_inv_spec} is discussing the moral and ethical aspects and the possible advantages of using simulations in order to find optimal methods for solving real world problems by using simulations.
