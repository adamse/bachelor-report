\subsection{Using models for simulating real world problems}
\label{sec:ethics_inv_spec}


The environment invasive species is a simulation of the problem with invasive
species and was first introduced in section \ref{sec:env_used}. This domain
focuses on the problem where a spreading process needs to be controlled in a
river network with native and invading plant species
\parencite{invasiveSpecis2014:Online}. 

It is commonly known how fragile ecosystems are to changes. It is a complex
system where one change could help the system in the short term while damaging it in the long
term. Therefore using simulations with self-learning algorithms allows to test
more methods than time and money would allow in the real world. The simulation is a rough model
of the real world and it is hard to capture all elements of the real-world
problem. Therefore, the answers from the simulation will also at best be roughly
correct.

This presents a practical use of reinforcement learning which simplified can be
viewed as a smart trial and error algorithm for finding good strategies for
working with real world problems like invasive species.
