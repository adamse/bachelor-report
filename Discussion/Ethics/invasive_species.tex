\subsection{Using models for simulating real world problems}
\label{sec:ethics_inv_spec}


The environment invasive species is a simulation of the problem with invasive
species and was first introduced in section \ref{sec:env_used}. This domain
focuses on the problem were a spreading process need to be controlled in a
river network with native and invading plant species
\parencite{invasiveSpecis2014:Online}. 

It is commonly known how fragile ecosystems is to changes. It is a complex
system were one change could help the system short term while damage it long
term. Therefore using simulations with self learning algorithms allows to test
more methods than time and money would allow. The simulation is a rough model
of the real world and it is hard to capture all elements of the real world
problem, therefore the answers from the simulation will also at best be roughly
correct.

This presents a practical use of reinforcement learning which simplified can be
viewed as a smart trial and error algorithm for finding good strategies for
working with real world problems like invasive species.
