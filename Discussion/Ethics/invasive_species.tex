% The environment used throughout this thesis has been a simulation regarding the problem with Invasive Species and was first introduced in section \ref{sec:constructing_experiments}. This domain focuses on the problem were the spreading process need to be controlled in a river network with native and invading plant species \parencite{invasiveSpecis2014:Online}. In the light of the results from this thesis and with regard to the progress made within this area the essence of simulations is rising. 

The environment Invasive Species Environment was used throughout this thesis. It is a simulation on the problem with invasive species and was first introduced in section \ref{sec:env_used}. This domain focuses on the problem were the spreading process need to be controlled in a river network with native and invading plant species \parencite{invasiveSpecis2014:Online}.

% Everyone knows how precious and fragile ecosystem today is to changes and especially making changes leading to more problems instead of helping the system. Therefore using simulations with self learning algorithms creates a whole new way of looking at the problem. The advantages almost present themselves, nevertheless the risks are today greater than the advantages. As of today the simulations are not advanced enough and act as simplifications of the real world and in order to create complete models of the environment requires too many parameters and computing power to be a viable solution. 

It is commonly known how fragile ecosystems is to changes. It is a complex system were one change could help the system short term while damage it long term. många actions Therefore using simulations with self learning algorithms allows to test more methods than time and money would allow. The simulations is a rough model of the real world so it's hard to capture all elements of the real world problem, therefore will the answers from the simulation also be roughly correct.

% This presents a practical use of reinforcement learning which simplified can be viewed as a smart trial and error algorithm for finding optimal plans for working with real world problems like invasive species. As a sequel to the next section(\ref{sec:hawkins}) this way of using AI have not been getting is fair share of attention in the rest of the world and is not in any ways presenting itself as a threat of our current lifestyle. Instead it shows the practical advantages that may present itself in the future within this field of study. Not only in simulations were taking actions today may be a danger to the nature, it could revolutionize the process of finding strategies even when humans are put into danger and planning problems. Instead of risking peoples lives, let the computer using RL algorithms to find better process and strategies for tackling complex problem and take human places in the testing phase or why not try to simulate different treatments for medicine and trying to optimize the treatments without risking lives. 

This presents a practical use of reinforcement learning which simplified can be viewed as a smart trial and error algorithm for finding optimal plans for working with real world problems like invasive species. This could revolutionize the process of finding strategies for planning problems. For example let a computer use reinforcement learning algorithms to simulate different treatments for medicine and try to optimize the treatment without risking lives. This way of using artificial intelligence is discussed in the next section(\ref{sec:hawkins}).
