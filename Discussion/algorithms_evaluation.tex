\section{Evaluation of the agents}
\label{sec:eval_of_agents}
As an initial comment, the fact that we have reasonable results proves that the techniques used work at least in a limited sense of the word. The tests completed within a reasonable time frame and did not run into hardware limitations. Furthermore, the results recorded show an increase in reward over time as expected of a working agent during its learning process.
