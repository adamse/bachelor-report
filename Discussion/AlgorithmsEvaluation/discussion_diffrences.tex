\subsection{DBN-\etre\ vs MBIE \note{N}}
\todo[inline]{Perhaps belongs in conclusion?}
An expectation on both agents is that they should converge on optimal behavior as $t$ goes to infinity. However, it is clear from the results presented in chapter \ref{ch:results} that neither version of the MBIE agent reaches the same level of performance as the DBN-\etre\ agent. 

\paragraph{Unfair comparisons} In one sense, the comparison between our implementations of MBIE and DBN-\etre\ are not very fair. The DBN-\etre\ implementation has been heavily optimized to work with factored MDPs and the invasive species environment in particular, whereas the MBIE implementation is much more generalized. %\parencite{strehl2004empirical} \note{It is thus not surprising that}
