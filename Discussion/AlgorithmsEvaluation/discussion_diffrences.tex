\subsection{DBN-\etre\ vs MBIE \note{N}}
\todo[inline]{Perhaps belongs in conclusion?}

An expectation on both agents is that they should converge on optimal behavior
as $t$ goes to infinity. However, it is clear from the results presented in
chapter \ref{ch:results} that neither version of the MBIE agent reaches the
same level of performance as the DBN-\etre\ agent. In the smaller problem as
seen for example in figure~\ref{fig:tests1}b the diffrence is not all that
diffrent between DBN-\etre\ agent and the realistic MBIE. Nevertheless, it is
still clear that DBN-\etre\ is far superior in finding the converging policy.
Previous studies have been concluded as a comparisson regarding the original
\etre\ algorithm and MBIE, in \textcite{strehl2004empirical} that MBIE
outperforms \etre\ in their testing environments. The results in this thesis
utilized a heavily optimized version of the original \etre\ agent using
factored representation and the results speak for themselfs mentioned earlier
in this report. 

\paragraph{Unfair comparisons}

In one sense, the comparison between our implementations of MBIE and DBN-\etre\
are not very fair. The DBN-\etre\ implementation has been heavily optimized to
work with factored MDPs and the invasive species environment in particular,
whereas the MBIE implementation is much more generalized. The discussions
regarding the generality of the agents in furher continued in section
\ref{sec:impact_of_one_env}. 

However, as mentioned in the last paragraph of
section \ref{sec:e3_factored_discussion} when the structure of the underlying
MDP the benefits of using a factored representations provides a big advantage
as seen in the figures in chapter \ref{ch:results}. This also increases the
responsibility on the designer of the factored representation and if done in
the wrong way it will prove to become a bottleneck instead of a performance
increase. 

test environments are not factored, name them.
a good model > a good algorithm

\paragraph{Large state spaces}

When the number of states are increased it is clear that the algorithms still
work. Comparing the 4 reaches and 3 habitats per reach case seen in
figure~\ref{fig:tests3}a with the 5 reaches and 3 habitats per reach case seen
in figure~\ref{fig:tests2}b this can be seen. The algorithms do still improve
over time although taking longer time to converge, which is expected as the
state space increases in size. 

A noteable difference between the original and realistic versions of MBIE is
that the realistic version has the same level of performance as the original
MBIE in larger state spaces whereas in smaller state spaces the realistic MBIE
was clearly better than the original. Compare figure~\ref{fig:tests1}b with
figure~\ref{fig:tests2}b to see this difference. In smaller state spaces the
realistic version will know the real value of more states than the original
version, while in larger state spaces both versions will prioritise unknown
states.

The DBN-\etre\ algorithm successfully deals with large state spaces. DBN-\etre\
utilizes a factored approach in representing transition probabilities, this
allows the algorithm to learn about the invironment quicker whereas a non
factored approach would struggle to learn the transition probabilities. This
can be seen in the result where the DBN-\etre\ algorithm quickly knows enough
to start exploiting. Furthermore, using a factored approach to policy
calculation allows quick policy calculations making the algorithm fast to run
in large state spaces.
