\subsection{Battle of the beasts: DBN-\etre\ vs MBIE \note{N}}

An expectation on both agents is that they should converge on optimal behavior as $t$ goes to infinity. However, it is clear from the results presented in chapter \ref{ch:results} that neither version of the MBIE agent reaches the same level of performance as the \etre\ agent. 

\paragraph{Unfair comparisons} In one sense, the comparison between our implementations of MBIE and \etre\ are not very fair. The \etre\ implementation has been heavily optimized to work with factored MDPs and the invasive species environment in particular, whereas the MBIE implementation is much more generalized. \parencite{strehl2004empirical} \note{It is thus not surprising that}
