\subsection{Impact of planning-frequency}
\label{sec:perform_planning_impact}
A factor to be considered when viewing the results is the impact of the frequency of planning. For example when looking at large state spaces in MBIE (both versions) planning is only performed when the sample size has increased by 50\%. This is quite infrequent when viewing our tests of 100 episodes of 100 samples per episode, resulting in many episodes using the same policy and making it harder to deduce improvement over time as they come in discrete intervals rather then continiously. This issue does not arise in DBN-\etre\ which does planning continiously when required.
