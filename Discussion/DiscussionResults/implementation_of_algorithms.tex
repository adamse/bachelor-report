\subsection{Implementation of algorithms}

One of the biggest challenges when constructing and evaluating algorithms is to
validate the actual implementation of the algorithm, especially when there is
no reference implementation to compare the result against. When building upon
the work of another creator there is always a possibilities that specifications
were erroneously interpreted or mistakes during the implementation lead to a less
efficient or even incorrect solution. The lack of similar work containing results
also makes it hard to estimate of how well our algorithms do in
comparison to similar implementations.

In order to increase the credibility of the implementations used one method is
to perform unit testing of the implementation. By creating implementations
which enable unit testing it becomes easier to test the individual pieces of
the algorithms and thereby verify correct behaviour. For more regarding
information the implementation process see appendix
\ref{ap:implementation_process}. Comparing the process of using automated tests
with manually validating the results of the complete algorithms behaviour as
described in section \ref{sec:implementation}, the advantages are obvious.
