\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Due to time constraints only two algorithms are tested, which apply different techniques. Furthermore, the evaluation of the selected algorithms is done in only one environment covering a certain problem with a large state space. 

% Our main focus will be on problems with discrete large state spaces. This stand in contrast to, for example, continuous problems, problems with a small state space or problems with a large action space. This thesis will also only focus on testing the selected algorithms in one given environment covering a certain kind of problem with large state space. The environment selected is the Invasive Species environment and is further described in section \ref{sec:env_used}.
