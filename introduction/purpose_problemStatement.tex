\section{Purpose and problem statement}

This thesis aims to further the knowledge of reinforcement learning or more specifically, algorithms applied to reinforcement learning problems with large state spaces. Reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with environments consisting of large state spaces due to practical limitations in memory usage and difficulties in estimating the value of actions and states within reasonable processing time. Therefore, we aim to evaluate techniques to circumvent or reduce the impact of these limitations by implementing algorithms using these techniques and testing them on problems of different sizes.
