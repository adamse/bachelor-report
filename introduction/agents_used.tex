\section{Agents to be evaluated}

Two algorithms that are suitable to the purpose and problem statement, since they apply different techniques for working with large state spaces, are Explicit Explore or Exploit in dynamic bayesian networks (DBN-\etre) and model-based interval estimation (MBIE). They are described in detail in chapter \ref{ch:algo}.
