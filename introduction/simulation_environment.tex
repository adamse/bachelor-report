\section{Simulation Environment}
\label{sec:env_used}
The environment used is Invasive Species from the Reinforcement Learning Competition, described in section \ref{sec:experiment_env}. Depending on the parameters, the problem can have both a large state space and/or a large action space. This makes Invasive Species a good choice with the given problem statement.
