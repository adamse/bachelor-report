In figures~\ref{fig:tests1}, \ref{fig:tests2} and \ref{fig:tests3} we present
test results from running our agents on the invasive species environment on
different sizes of river networks. The collected data can be found in
appendix~\ref{ap:result_tables}.

The agent learns for 100 episodes with 100 samples per episode, other
parameters are specified in section~\ref{sec:test_spec}. The invasive species
environment associates a certain cost with each state and action, thus the
reward is always negative.

With smaller state spaces (see figure~\ref{fig:3r3h}, \ref{fig:3r2h} and
\ref{fig:5r1h}) we can see that the realistic MBIE agent outperforms the
original MBIE agent and comes close to the DBN-\etre\ agent. In the tests where
the state space is larger (see figure~\ref{fig:5r3h}, \ref{fig:10r1h} and
\ref{fig:4r3h}) original MBIE and realistic MBIE are very close to each other
in performance while the DBN-\etre\ agent outperforms both.

In each of the test runs, the DBN-\etre\ algorithm exhibits a period of learning
that corresponds to exploration (as described in section~\ref{sec:e3}) where
the agent has not explored the environment enough and seeks more information.
This is apparent in figure~\ref{fig:3r3h}.
