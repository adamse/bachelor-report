\subsection{Testing algorithms in more environments \note{N}}
As mentioned in the limitations (\ref{sec:limitations}) only one environment is used for collecting the results. Thereby, it is hard to verify how generic the algorithms performs. Due to the close ties to the environment Invasive Species during the development there is a risk that the algorithms does not perform well in other environments. Place has been left in the thesis for improvement and a possibility to conclude the generality of the algorithms studied in this thesis. One possible environment to extend the study with is the Tetris domain representing the game of Tetris from the 2008 edition of the Reinforcement Learning competition \parencite{whiteson2010reinforcement}.
