\section{Implementation \note{Ny Text}}
The work in this phase was divided into two separate projects developing the two types of agents independently of each other. Therefore the processes used by the two groups may differ at some points from what is described in the following subsections. Nevertheless the overall and important steps and processes used is the same in both groups. First and foremost the agents were constructed, based on the results of the pre-study (section \ref{sec:pre_study}) and is covered in the first of the following subsections. Then in the second phase there is a description about how the experiments were constructed, along with the strategies used in the experiment phase and how the code was verified during the experiments.
