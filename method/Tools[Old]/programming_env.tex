\subsection{Programming environment \note{N}}
\label{sec:prog_env}
During the project the Java programming language version 1.7, was used to implement the agents. The focus is on understanding what are being implemented and therefore it would be beneficial to choose a programming language that is familiar to everyone in the group. By choosing an object oriented and statically typed programming language familiar to the group, it will aid the project. In addition, the java version of RL-Glue framework version 3.0 was used.
