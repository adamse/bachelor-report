\paragraph{Planning in dynamic Bayesian networks}

The DBN-\etre\ algorithm does not in itself define what algorithm should be
used for planning when the MDP is structured as a DBN
\parencite{kearns1999efficient}. It considers planning a black box, leaving the
choice of planning algorithm to the implementers. 

Value iteration can be done with a factored representation of an MDP in a
fairly straightforward manner. The same equations that normal value iteration
(section~\ref{sec:valueiteration}) is based on can be used when the MDP is
factored too. The only difference is that in order to calculate the probability
of a state transition, $P(s'| a, s)$ one has to find the product of all the
partial transitions,
\begin{equation}
  \prod\limits _{i} P\left(s_i' | a, pa(s_i)\right)
\end{equation}
where $i$ ranges over all partial states and $pa(s_i)$ is the setting of the
parents of the partial state $s_i$.

When an MDP has this structure, observations of partial transitions can be
pooled together when the state variables are part of similar structures in the
MDP. In the version of DBN-\etre\ described here, all state variables that have
the same number of parent variables have their observations pooled together.
