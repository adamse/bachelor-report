\section{Evaluating agents \note{N}}
\label{sec:eval_agents}

To evaluate the agents in the invasive species environment we picked combinations of reaches and number of habitats per reach that can be seen in table~\ref{tab:reaches_habitats}. Combinations were chosen to have a wide range in the total number of states for the agents to deal with and to test how the agents deal with taking actions that have to take into account several state components.

 Reaches & Habitats & Total states \\
