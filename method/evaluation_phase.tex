\section{Evaluation \note{N}}
\label{sec:evaluation}
The last phase of the project was the evaluation phase, where the main focus was on interpreting the results from the implementation phase. This section walks through the different aspects taken into consideration when evaluating the agents. Along with answering questions regarding what are the key aspects of constructing a complete an d trustworthy test along with the specifications used when testing the algorithms. What strategies are used for retrieving useful and valid results and how is the results of a experiment validated. The two selected will be tested in the invasive species environment and the first section will also disclose the parameters used for the different experiments. 

The second interesting aspect of the evaluation phase is how the results are going to be interpreted with regard to the environment. Along with the fact that the test are going to be constructed in such way that they will be able to generate meaningful results for comparing the two agents in such a way to be able to create a recommendation.
