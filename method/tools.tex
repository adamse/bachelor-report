\section{Tools \note{Ny text}}
\label{sec:tools}
In order to go from abstract descriptions of agents into fully functional algorithms running on our computers there is a need for tools to aid the process. In this section there is a description of the tools used in the project, all from the programming language used to the key framework for constructing experiments and test the agents in simulated environments. Together with a presentation of the motivations behind the choices made when selecting the tools and technologies used in the project.
